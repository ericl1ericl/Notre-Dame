Internally, the program is complicated.  Strings are used to hold the 
initial input.  These strings are then pushed into linked lists that hold 
each individual value.  Next, a function is called that should add these 
two numbers together.

This function operates by getting adding digits in the ones place, then 
tens place, and so on.  It mimics adding by hand.  If the sum of this 
addition is greater than ten, a carryover is generated.  The remainder of 
the original sum when divided by ten will be the final digit.  To get the 
next sum, the carryover is added to the next two digits.

For the linked list, each remainder is pushed into the final list number.  
At the very end, the last carryover value is tacked on top.

To print, a while loop checks the final number until it ends.  It displays 
each value it checks.

I could not determine the issues with my code.  The first issue is that it 
cannot handle unequal list lengths.  This is probably a problem within the 
addNumberLists function.  If one number list ends before the other, it 
probably causes problems.  My code also displays incorrect sums.  Either 
this is an issue with the display function at the end, or an error in the 
addition logic.  It is probably more likely to be an issue in addition 
logic, if not an issue with incorrect pointers.

Deconstructors are needed with dynamic memory allocation to prevent 
memory errors.  Once the pointers to the used memory are deleted, there 
is no way to access that space later to delete it.  Thus, it is 
necessary to delete it while the pointers are still in place, hence the 
deconstructors.
