Additional notes on apex.oracle:
I missed the email button to activate my apex workspace CSE40746, 
	and as such could not figure out why I could not login.
I tried creating a new workspace CSE40746_2, which of course
	did not help.
I eventually figured out I needed to activate CSE40746, so
	I do not need CSE40746_2.  This can be deactivated by the
	admin.
I also only requested 10mB of space - hopefully this is enough.
