I successfully downloaded files from Prof. Bualuan and uploaded them to live.oracle.
I created an account on live.oracle.
I successfully ran files createall.sql and insertall.sql to create sale database on live.oracle.
On live.oracle, I wrote my 3 homework queries.  Doing so allowed me to test every iteration of
	the query writing process.
Thus, all homework queries work on live.oracle.  Successful queries copied to personal AFS .sql
	files.

I used my live.oracle account to request a workspace on apex.
I requested "application development".
I set up my schema names - hw3.
I received the email and joined apex.
I uploaded and ran create and insert files.
In SQL Workshop -> SQL Commands, I copied my three queries and ran each successfully.
Apex is much more complicated than live - it will take time to get used to.
