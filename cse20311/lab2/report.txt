Part three of the assignment was to represent a function on an ASCII 
graph.  I decided to use the wave function y = 2*(sin(2x)+cos(3x))+4.

From the user's perspective, the program simply displays the graph. First, 
it explains what the function is and the domain.  In this case, the domain 
is from 0 to 25.  Then, the program prints out the graph. The number of 
"#" symbols represents the y value.  In this case, each "#" represents 
0.2.  Finally, the program states the maximum and minimum of the curve as 
well as their respective positions on the x-axis.

Internally, the program is broken up into several stages.

First, the initial sentence is created, which tells the function and the 
domain.  This requires the initial and final points of the domain to be 
defined as variables.

Second, there is a line that says "X" and "Y" to denote where these values 
are.

The third section is the main bulk of the program. A series of 
variables are defined, as commented on within the program. Then a loop 
starts, which contains several phases, and goes from the beginning to the end of the domain. First, it displays the current x value. Second, it calculates the y value at the current x value, and displays this. Third, it determines if the y value is either a minimum or a maximum using a series of if statements. Fourth, it graphs the amplitude of y using "#" signs.  It does so by calculating the number of symbols to be used (in this case, each "#" is 0.2 of y), then by using a for loop to print the proper number of "#" signs out. Fifth and final, the x value is incremented up.  This loop of five steps continues until the end of the domain is reached.

The fourth and final section of the program prints out the maximum and minimum y values and their respective x positions.

I verified the program was correct by using a graphing calculator and checking the shape of the curve as well as values.
